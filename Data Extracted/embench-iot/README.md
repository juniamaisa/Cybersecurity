# Raw Data Collection â€“ Embench-IoT Benchmark

This folder contains the unprocessed data collected from the execution of benchmarks from the *Embench-IoT* suite (https://github.com/embench/embench-iot).

The data was generated by running 64-bit RISC-V binaries using QEMU (qemu-riscv64, version 9.2.3) in combination with a custom plugin designed to extract instruction-level traces. These traces capture detailed information about each executed instruction, providing fine-grained visibility into the runtime behavior of the benchmark programs.

The file was named titancfi.json
